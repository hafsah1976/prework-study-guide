        <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible  content shown to the user</li>
        <li>The image tag allows us to add images to the webpage</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>CSS is a stylesheet that has to be linked to the HTML file in order to see the formatting results we desire.</li>
    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
  <li>the period before card indicates that it is a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
<li>the box shadow property requires two offsets- x axis and y axis.the function of box-shadow is self explanatory. it is used to create the shadow effect in a table on a webpage.</li> 
<li>We can either use hexadecimal code to select the color we want or use semantic references.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is an Object-Oriented Programming language. </li>
          <li>It is a popular coding language used to create interactive multimedia websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
   <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, therefore we must code accordingly, for example we must define our global variables at the top.</li>
   <li>When we create a function, we are creating a specific task by defining a block of code, and we have to give it a unique name so that it doesn't clash with built-in functions.</li> 
  <li>However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically, we must call it in our code.</li>
