      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible  content shown to the user</li>
        <li>The image tag allows us to add images to the webpage</li>
        <li>The heading tags range from h1 to h6</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>CSS is a stylesheet that has to be linked to the HTML file in order to see the formatting results we desire.</li>
    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
  <li>the period before card indicates that it is a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
<li>the box shadow property requires two offsets- x axis and y axis.the function of box-shadow is self explanatory. it is used to create the shadow effect in a table on a webpage.</li> 
<li>We can either use hexadecimal code to select the color we want or use semantic references.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Git version control is used to keep track of content changes that I am going to make in my project(s).</li>
       <li>git pull origin main is used to get to the main branch</li>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>git push origin main is used to push the changes made in the feature branch to the base branch</li> 
    <li>After we have pushed changes, we are supposed to create a pull request. pull request allows other developers to give feedback on our code.</li>
    <li>Git flow is when we create/switch to a branch from the main, using git checkout -b branchname, make as many changes as we like, save the files and use git add -A command to commit changes in the working branch.</li>
    <li>Then use git commit -m in the terminal to precisely describe say in a sentence the changes we have implemented. </li>
    <li>Use git pull origin main to ensure that your current branch is up to date. It should output something along the lines "Already up to date" only then you must open a pull request.</li>
    <li>It is a good habit your pull base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code, specially if you're working in a group. Use the git push origin 'branchname' command to push your changes to the main branch.</li> 
  <li>Now navigate to your GitHub repository, create a pull request. Then compare the two branches that need to be merged. The base branch is the main branch, it should be first as we want to compare and merge the branch we have created into the base branch.</li> 
  <li>We could assign a team member to review the changes we have made using the github. Once the changes have been approved, we can merge the pull request and close the issue.</li>  
  </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is an Object-Oriented Programming language. </li>
          <li>It is a popular coding language used to create interactive multimedia websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
   <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, therefore we must code accordingly, for example we must define our global variables at the top.</li>
   <li>When we create a function, we are creating a specific task by defining a block of code, and we have to give it a unique name so that it doesn't clash with built-in functions.</li> 
  <li>However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically, we must call it in our code.</li>
